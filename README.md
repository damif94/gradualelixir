# A gradual type checker for a fragment of the Elixir language

## Introduction

This project was carried out in the context of my bachelor 's degree thesis at the Engineering Faculty of UDELAR (Universidad de la Rep√∫blica, Uruguay). The main objective was to adapt the gradual typing discipline to the [Elixir programming language](https://elixir-lang.org/), in a careful way so as to endow the designed type system with:
- **The Static Gradual Guarantee**: This constitutes a crucial quality standard about gradual type-checkers, and implies "well-behavior" of the type-checked programs as they get more heavily type-annotated.
- **A cast-based gradual evaluation semantics** for type-checked programs: This will transfer the type information to the runtime system, in order to make the execution errors of the typed portions of match with the optimistic guesses based on the dynamic type usage.   

The proof for the Static Gradual Guarantee was achieved by considering a formal syntax for the language and a set of algorithmic rules for the type system. On the other hand, the gradual semantics is based on the definition of a cast enrichment translation for the type-checked programs (as cast calculus from the literature) and a macro-based implementation for the casts. 


Instead of setting the whole Elixir syntax as our aim, we decided to focus on a restricted portion of the language -which is still Turing-complete, though- for two different reasons:
- In order to establish the desirable formal properties for our system, deeper research should be carried out to make our design still correct for some constructs that are available on the full syntax (multiple clauses for function definitions, for instance).
- The time and resources that were available prevent us from including a lot of extra portions of the full syntax that would nevertheless follow mostly straightforward from the current design.


## Implementation Overview

The implementation of the project can be considered as divided in these main components:
- **The type checker** was implemented in python for personal convenience in the context of a tight schedule.
- **The cast enrichment** translation was written in python as it constitutes a plugin for the type checker.
- **The cast semantics** was implemented indirectly by defining a macro on the elixir language.

Even if it was possible to write the type checker and the cast enrichment as a single process, they were build separately because we think it will easier for a reader to understand them in isolation; the type checker as the _core_ process and the cast enrichment as a _consumer_ of the former.

**Disclaimer:** The implementation is far from being ready to be used for real-world codebases, because it wasn't built with a focus on efficiency. My view is that its value lies more on the methodology than anything else.


## Setup
### Docker (recommended)
[Docker ](https://www.docker.com/) is a popular tool that allows to distribute and run software from lightweight containers easily and with complete independence from the host machine. 

To carry out the docker-based setup, the OS-specific docker desktop application should be installed and running. Also, this repository should be cloned somewhere in the filesystem and renamed to `gradualelixir`.  

The docker installation goes as simple as running 
```bash
docker compose up
```
within the root folder of the repository.

In order to start the gradualelixir container, choose a `working_dir` folder to use
as root for the gradualelixir cli. For example, I am using `/Users/damian/Documents` on my macos. 

Execute
```bash
alias gradualelixir="docker run -it -v <working_dir>:/resources/ --rm gradualelixir"
```

Every time you start a new session or want to change the `working_dir` folder, you must execute this command again.

You can try interacting with the cli, by executing
```bash
gradualelixir --help
```

## Standard
We assume that you have a recent version of `elixir` installed (>= 1.11), plus a recent version of `python3` (>= 3.8) and `pip3`
in your system. For debian based distributions, an installation of `python3-venv` is also required.

1. Clone this repository and open a terminal on the root directory.
2. Turn the `gradualelixir` file into an executable by running
```bash
chmod +x gradualelixir
```
3. Execute the cli for the first time to set up the python virtualenv with the project dependencies.
```bash
./gradualelixir --help
```
This will also display all the available commands.

4. Install mix dependencies inside `elixir_port/`
```bash
mix deps.get
```

5. The usage of each command is also documented. Before using it, run in the root folder:
```bash
./gradualelixir <command_name> --help
```

## Examples

In [Walkthrough](/Walkthrough.md) you can find a series of guided examples to get familiar with the cli.

Moreover, the project comes with a bunch of examples of valid (and some invalid) programs to be tried out.
These are located under the `examples/` subfolder. The easiest way to use use them is by setting the working directory to that folder, by running:
```bash
./gradualelixir configure --working-dir examples/
```
